# Stance on commercial use of the software

Thanks for considering Uppi. This software is released under the Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC)
[license](LICENSE). You may use, modify, and share it, as long as you do not directly profit from it. Uppi was created
to help developers
and organizations monitor their services without the need for expensive third-party solutions. The non-commercial
license is
designed to ensure that the software remains accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial resources.

Non-commercial use under the CC-BY-NC license refers to any activity that is not primarily intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. This means you can incorporate the uptime monitor into your
projects, services, or operations without directly profiting from the software itself. However, generating revenue
directly from the software’s core functionalities is prohibited.

#### Permitted Uses

You are allowed to integrate Uppi into broader services or use it internally within your
organization without charging specifically for the monitoring tool. This includes:

- Internal Operations: Utilizing the software to monitor your own websites or systems as part of your internal processes
  without offering the monitor as a standalone paid feature.
- Indirect Monetization: Including the uptime monitor as part of a service that generates revenue from other aspects, as
  long as the monitor itself is not the primary source of income. For example, a hosting company or agency that includes
  monitoring as part of a service-level agreement. You are prohibited to sell it as a standalone product or service.
- Service Integration: Embedding the uptime monitor into a suite of services you offer, where the monitor is one
  component of a larger, non-revenue-generating package.

#### Prohibited Uses

Directly profiting from Uppi by selling the software or its core functionalities is not permitted.
This includes:

- Selling the Software: Offering the uptime monitor as a standalone product for purchase or licensing it to others for a
  fee.
- Charging for Access: Implementing subscription models or premium tiers where users pay specifically to access the
  monitoring features or access to the software itself.
- Standalone Services: Providing the uptime monitoring functionality as a separate, paid service independent of other
  offerings.
